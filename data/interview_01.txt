Question 1:  I was in conversation with a donor about a gift, when they mentioned their child was in the applicant pool.  What should I do?

Answer: You should respectfully inform the potential donor that it is NYU’s policy that we do not engage in gift conversations with anyone when we know that they have a family member in the applicant pool.  Once the admissions process has passed, you look forward to continuing the conversation about a gift at that point. You should also note that NYU does not accept gifts intended to influence the admissions process.

Question 2: My prospect has a child who is a sophomore in high school.  Can I pursue a gift conversation with that donor?

Answer: The policy only applies to family members who are in the applicant pool so you could pursue a gift conversation with this prospect. However, if the prospect indicates that they hope their gift will influence the admissions decision if the child applies to NYU, the prospect should be told that admissions decisions are not influenced by a person’s philanthropic support and that NYU does not accept gifts intended to influence the admissions process.

Question 3: My prospect says that they are only considering making a gift because they want to increase their child’s chance for future admission.  What should I say?

Answer:  You should emphasize that admissions decisions are made solely by the admissions office and that NYU does not accept gifts intended to influence the admissions process.  You would love the donor to make the gift, but you should emphasize that their giving will not have any influence over their child’s chances and if that is the only reason they are making the gift, they may want to reconsider their decision as NYU is increasingly competitive for admission and currently less than 15% of students who apply are admitted.  If the child is currently in the applicant pool you should cite the NYU policy that we do not engage in gift conversations with anyone who has a family member in the applicant pool and postpone the conversation until after an admissions decision has been made by NYU. If the child is not in the applicant pool and depending on the circumstances, the gift conversation may continue, but you may want to flag this issue for your supervisor and document the conversations with the donor regarding the policy that NYU does not accept gifts intended to influence the admissions process.

Question 4: An educational consultant tells a fundraiser that the child of a foreign billionaire is applying to NYU and that they would like to help the parent make a gift to NYU.

Answer:  The fundraiser should thank the consultant for sharing this information and then inform the consultant that it is NYU’s policy that we do not engage in gift conversations with anyone when we know that a potential donor has a family member in the applicant pool.  Once the admissions process has passed, you look forward to continuing the conversation directly with the potential donor about a gift at that point. You should also note that NYU does not accept gifts intended to influence the admissions process. 

Question 5:  An existing or prospective donor in the process of a gift conversation mentions their neighbor is applying to NYU this year and indicates that the donor hopes that this gift will positively affect the neighbor’s chances of admissions. 

Answer: You may continue the gift conversation, but you should emphasize that admissions decisions are made solely by the admissions office and explicitly state that NYU does not accept gifts intended to influence the admissions process.  You would love the donor to make the gift, but you should emphasize that their giving will not have any influence over the neighbor’s chances and if that is the only reason they are making the gift, they may want to reconsider their decision as NYU is increasingly competitive for admission and currently less than 15% of students who apply are admitted.   Depending on the circumstances, you may want to flag this issue for your supervisor and document the conversations with the donor regarding the policy that NYU does not accept gifts intended to influence the admissions process.
